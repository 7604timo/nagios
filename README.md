A few scripts I've had to make to make my life easier:

```canon_printers.pl```

Uses SNMP to query Canon irAdv printers for things like:
Toner levels and toner bottle type
Firmware / serial number
Current Error (if any)
Type of attached finisher unit
Staples left in finisher unit
How much paper is left in each drawer
